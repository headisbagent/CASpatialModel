# California Spatial Modeling Project

This GitHub repository houses the University of California, Davis Energy Futures Program's spatial model of the transportation and electricity grid system in California to investigate scenarios of a hydrogen economy.  The project is divided into a transport demand and infrastructure module and an electricity grid module.

# Travel Demand Module

# Electricity Grid Module
The electricity grid module is a subversion of the Grid Operation Optimized Dispatch (GOOD) model.
